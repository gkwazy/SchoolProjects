//Define a struct to describe a politician. It should include fields to keep track of their name, party affiliation, and whether they're a state or federal politician. Assume your politicians operate in a 2-party system (they're each either a republican or a democrat).
//
//Write the following functions below, along with a set of tests in main() to verify that they work correctly.
//
//Write a function named democrats that takes a vector of politicians and returns a vector with only the politicians from the input that are democrats.
//
//Write a function named federalRepublicans that takes a vector of politicians as a parameter and returns a list of the federal republicans from the input.

#include <vector>

    vector <politician> domocratVector;

                domocratVector.push_back(poly);
