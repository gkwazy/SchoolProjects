//**Question 1: this code look to me that it is making a custom variable type (time). then the code is calling
//    the method localtime to get the number of seconds from epoch. std::time is also a method call to make
//    the variable.

//**Question 2: you would not want to get the std:cin from your function because you are only able to return one
//item. so you would not be able to save it and do the math you are wanting to do in the function.

//** Question 3: it would be hard to trun the speed/velocity task into a fuction because you have two different values you are trying to get but your return can only have one value.

//** Question 4: you could have it return a array so that you can pars out the data from it.
