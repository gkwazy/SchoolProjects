Part one of lab -pings
To my So, I send a ping to myself over the wifi so see what i would get. I looked that I was sending the ping to my router then after a bit the router would send the ping to my computer. What was in the packet i could not tell, just a bunch of gibberish in English but I bet in binary it is asking for a return signal.
Part two http
When I first when to the web page the program showed that it was sending requests for information and the webserver would respond with an ok or 200 code. Then I would send the HTML and the CSS.  
When I used the terminal for the call all it sends back was the okay or 200 code but I never got back the HTML or CSS from the server
Most of the output looks to be encrypted or just not readable. It might be in binary or encrypted
